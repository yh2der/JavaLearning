# Data Structures and Algorithms Learning Material
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Learning Material repository! This repository was originally created for my personal review, but I also hope that it can serve as a comprehensive resource for those in need to directly access complete information on data structures and algorithms.

# Introduction
This section provides an overview of the purpose and content of the learning material. It explains the importance of understanding data structures and algorithms in computer science and software development.

# Content Structure
* Data Structures: This section covers various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs. Each data structure includes detailed explanations, implementation examples, and exercises.

* Algorithms: This section explores fundamental algorithms including sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort), searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search), graph algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search, depth-first search), and dynamic programming algorithms.
